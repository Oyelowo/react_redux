React 16.2 Feature: Fragments
Section 7, Lecture 93
If your project uses React 16.2, you can now use a built-in "Aux" component - a so called fragment.

It's actually not called Aux  but you simply use <>  - an empty JSX tag.

So the following code

<Aux>
    <h1>First Element</h1>
    <h1>Second Element</h1>
</Aux>
becomes

<>
    <h1>First Element</h1>
    <h1>Second Element</h1>
</>
Behind the scenes, it does the same our Aux  component did.
