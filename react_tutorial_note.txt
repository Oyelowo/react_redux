The above JSX is transpiled into the below, using babeljs.io/repl

Components should be capitalised at the beginning


state vs prop.
useful for dynamic website.
state does from inside, prop does it from outside

setState lets you understand how virtual DOM works.


you can only create state in class that extends Component object.
functional components are stateless components and cannot be used if you need to set state.

break should be used as <br/> in jsx and not just <br> which works in normal html.

events are passed down but triggered upward.

state cannot be mutated. so, sometimes, u have to create a copy of the state
