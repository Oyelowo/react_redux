 return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1>I am a good guy </h1> 
      </div>
    );
    // above jsx gets compiled into the javascript below. This is why we import react. it creates element in the background:
However, using the below format doesn't make sense as it is cumbersome.
    // return React.createElement('div', {className: 'App'}, React.createElement('hi', null, 'Hi, i am react app!!'));

 
NOTE:
when using a method/function in event handling in the rendering session of a class. don't use the paranthesis at the end of the function because it executes it immediately the browser renders the component.

-you can also pass methods as props, so that you can call a method which might change its state from another component which doesnt and shouldnt have direct access to the state.

State is immutable.
